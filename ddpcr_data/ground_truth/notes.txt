1. Generate lambda estimates with python script ('ddpcr_lam_est_final.py')
2. Save to '22-07-13_concs.mat' 
- note A1->12 is alphabetical bacterial order, as is B12->1. Staph and Strep grouped
3. Note A09 had corrupt ddPCR data (S. epid concentration #1) - happened to not be used in samples 


Note that samples with 'concentration 1' and 'concentration 2' were decided before the experiment,
and the following is to combine the ground truth lambdas into the heatmap

4. Generate the 'lamTrue' file
- open rand_sample_combos_weighted.m
- load in mat file with 'concs'
- run
- combine the generated heatmap variables into one lamTrue array
- lamTrue ~= [heatMaps(1), heatMaps(2), heatMaps(3)]


lamTrue = [heatMaps{1}, heatMaps{2}, heatMaps{3}]
lamTrue(:,[11, 12]) = lamTrue(:,[12, 11])
lamTrue(:,6) = 0

- Note that sparsity 3, samples 5 and 6 were switched on the plate, so manually flipped them (columns 5 and 6 in heatMaps(2))
- lamTrue(:,6) = 0 (negative control)


5. ecloac_p (probability of its HEX probe 1) is estimated as ~0.83
